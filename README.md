# AgenticGPT4GP
This project delivers a clinical triage assistant that ingests GP referral letters (PDF, DOCX, TXT, and images via OCR), summarizes them, classifies urgency across specialties, and generates actionable recommendations. Powered by LLM, it combines retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) with agentic AI orchestration to provide guideline‑aware outputs.
