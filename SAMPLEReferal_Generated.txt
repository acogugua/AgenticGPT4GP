Dear Dr Carter,

I am referring Mr John Matthews, a 40-year-old male, for further gastroenterology assessment and management.

John has presented with a six-month history of intermittent abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. He reports episodes of loose stools alternating with constipation. 
Symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past two months, and he notes increased fatigue and no chest pains or loss of breath.

On examination, his abdomen was soft with mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. No guarding, rigidity, or organomegaly noted. Vital signs within normal ranges.  

Investigations completed:

FBC: within normal limits

CRP: mildly elevated at 9 mg/L

LFTs: normal

Coeliac serology: negative

Abdominal ultrasound: unremarkable

Stool culture: negative

Given the chronicity of symptoms, mild inflammatory markers, and ongoing discomfort, I am requesting your expertise for further evaluation, including consideration of colonoscopy and assessment for possible inflammatory bowel disease or IBS.

Medications:

Paracetamol PRN

No regular medications

No known allergies

Please feel free to contact me if further information is required.

Kind regards,
Dr Sarah Thompson
